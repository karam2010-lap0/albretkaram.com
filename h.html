    <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
    <p> Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. From a young age, he showed a deep curiosity for nature and an exceptional ability in mathematics and physics. He studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he developed his foundational ideas in science.  

  In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including the special theory of relativity, which introduced the famous equation E=mc². This year became known as his "Annus Mirabilis" or "miracle year."  

  Later, he developed the general theory of relativity, revolutionizing the understanding of gravity. His theories changed modern physics and opened new frontiers in cosmology and technology.  

  Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect, not relativity. He was also known for his deep humanitarian views and advocacy for peace and civil rights.  

  In 1933, he fled Nazi Germany and settled in the United States, where he worked at Princeton University until his death in 1955. Albert Einstein remains a symbol of scientific genius and human wisdom.
